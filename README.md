# PlayMix

The PlayMix project simulate an android mobile games store based on monthly subscriptions users.

This project combines real time database use. We chose fire base as database as it provides very efficient interface.
Interaction with the databse is demonstrated among most classes in the app.

Users may register in many ways such as facebook , email and more.
There are three categories of subscriptions: Diamond, gold and free where there are special content for each type of the subscriptions.
Users also may upgrade their subscription status, interacting with the build-in payment system of the application.
